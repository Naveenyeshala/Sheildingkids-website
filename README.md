# Sheildingkids-website

I've had the honor of crafting a website with payment gateway integration for SheildingKids ðŸŒˆ. The SheildingKids website is a compassionate platform committed to aiding children in need through charitable donations on a global scale. Featuring a user-friendly interface, visitors can effortlessly find the donation button, guiding them to the payment page with ease. Once the donation process is finalized, donors promptly receive an invoice via email, ensuring they have a documented record of their contribution
